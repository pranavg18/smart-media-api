# Smart Media API
Smart Media API is a Spring Boot backend designed to transform unstructed media into structured data using Generative AI. It integrates OpenAI's Whisper model to 
provide accurate audio-to-text transcription and leverages GPT-4o's vision capabilites to extract detailed financial data from images of receipts, automatically categorizing expenses and identifying line items.

Built with Java 17 and Spring AI framework, this project demonstrates a modern approach to handling multimodal inputs (audio and vision) in a scalable backend 
architecture. It features clean RESTful endpoints for uploading files and returns structured JSON responses.
